                    This section provides an analysis of the researchers involved in the RAISE project.
                    The objective is to visualize the workforce distribution across three key dimensions: institutional
                    affiliation, geographic location, and thematic research expertise.

                            The RAISE ecosystem is built on strong institutional pillars.
                            This bubble chart visualizes the <strong>volume of contributions</strong>
                            per researcher, showing their institutional affiliations .
                            Larger bubbles indicate a higher number of registered publications,
                            highlighting the key contributors within each organization.

                            Utilizing semantic analysis of publication topics, this tool
                            categorizes experts into primary domains (e.g., Computer Science, Engineering)
                            and visualizes their specific focus topics, facilitating the identification of specific
                            experts.
