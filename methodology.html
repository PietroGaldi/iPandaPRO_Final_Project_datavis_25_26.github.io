                        <p>
                            The data used to generate the visualizations were retrieved from <strong>OpenAlex</strong>,
                            an open catalog of works, authors, institutions, and related metadata.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Relevant publications were identified by querying funding information associated with
                            RAISE (code <strong>ECS00000035</strong>). Unique identifiers linked to these funded
                            outputs were then used to retrieve the corresponding records from OpenAlex.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This process ensured a consistent and structured dataset covering publications, authorship,
                            institutional affiliations, venues, and geographic information. All subsequent data
                            processing, aggregation, and transformation steps were performed on the OpenAlex metadata
                            to support the analytical and visual components of the project.

                            The primary dataset is stored in <code>openalex_works_full.csv</code>, which aggregates
                            all information retrieved via the OpenAlex API, including a raw JSON column containing
                            the original data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To optimize data handling, Python scripts were employed to generate two specific CSV files:
                            <em>openalex_people.csv</em>, which details the <strong>researchers involved</strong>, and
                            <em>institutions_osm_coords.csv</em>, which lists the <strong>participating
                                institutions</strong>.
                            Geographic coordinates were geocoded into the institutions file using OpenStreetMap,
                            with manual corrections applied to ensure locational accuracy.

                                    <strong>Entities:</strong> Since the raw data separates authors and works,
                                    a link was created between each researcher and their publications.
                                    This allows the calculation of metrics such as "Total Works per Researcher"
                                    and "Primary Research Topic".
                                </li>

                                    <strong>Topic analysis:</strong> The <code>raw_json</code> column contains
                                    categorization levels: Level 0 (Domain) and Level 1 (Topic).
                                    Authors are classified based on the dominance of these concepts in their
                                    publication history.

                                    the count of distinct institutions per country.

                                    <strong>Treemap:</strong> The pipeline processed affiliation data to calculate
                                    publication volume per institution. The visualization uses a squarified layout
                                    where area corresponds to publication count.

                                    institutions. Relationships were quantified by iterating through publications
                                    to identify co-authorship pairs.

                                    Links represent unique pairs of institutions listed on the same publication,
                                    weighted by collaboration frequency.

                        <h2>Limitations & Constraints</h2>
                        <p>
                            The visualizations presented are subject to data quality limitations inherent to the source,
                            OpenAlex. Because OpenAlex relies on automated algorithms to aggregate vast amounts of
                            bibliographic data, it lacks human manual curation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Consequently, the dataset contains noise; for example, the use of author aliases may
                            result in disambiguation errors, where a single physical researcher is represented by
                            multiple distinct author profiles. This limitation extends to the classification of
                            categories and topics, which are ingested directly from OpenAlex and thus subject to the
                            same automated tagging inaccuracies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, the project is subject to temporal constraints. As the RAISE project is
                            currently ongoing, the data represents a snapshot in time and is necessarily incomplete
                            regarding the final output of the research.
