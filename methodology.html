                        <li>Entities: Since the raw data separates authors and works, it's created a link between each
                            researcher and its publications.
                            This allows the calculation of metrics such as "Total Works per Researcher" and "Primary
                            Research
                            Topic".</li>

                        <li>Topic analysis: The column raw_json of the original full csv contains different levels of
                            publicaion categorization:
                            Level 0 (Domain) and Level 1 (Topic). This categorization comes directly from the OpenAlex
                            structure of the dataset.
                            Authors are then classified based on the dominance of these concepts in their publication
                            history, assigning a "Primary Category" to each researcher.</li>

                            geographic coordinates. Links were established by identifying unique pairs of institutions
                            listed on the same publication, with edge weights representing the aggregated frequency of
                            collaboration.</li>
