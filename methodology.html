            <main>
                <h2>Data sources</h2>
                <ul>The data used to generate the visualizations were retrieved from OpenAlex, an open catalog of works, authors, institutions, and related metadata. <br>
                Relevant publications were identified by querying funding information associated with RAISE (code ECS00000035). Unique identifiers linked to these funded outputs were then used to retrieve the corresponding records from OpenAlex. <br>
                This process ensured a consistent and structured dataset covering publications, authorship, institutional affiliations, venues, and geographic information. <br>
                All subsequent data processing, aggregation, and transformation steps were performed on the OpenAlex metadata to support the analytical and visual components of the project. <br>
                </ul>

                <h2>Data cleaning</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creation of institutions.csv and people.csv through python scripts (+raw_json column)</li>
                    <li>Fix of coordinates for the institutions</li>
                    <li>Altro?</li>
                </ul>
                <hr class="section-divider">

                <h2>Data processing</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>People page</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Entities: Since the raw data separates authors and works, it's created a link between each
                            researcher and its publications.
                            This allows the calculation of metrics such as "Total Works per Researcher" and "Primary
                            Research
                            Topic".</li>

                        <li>Topic analysis: The column raw_json of the original full csv contains different levels of
                            publicaion categorization:
                            Level 0 (Domain) and Level 1 (Topic). This categorization comes directly from the OpenAlex
                            structure of the dataset.
                            Authors are then classified based on the dominance of these concepts in their publication
                            history, assigning a "Primary Category" to each researcher.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Choropleth map: Geospatial data was integrated with publication records by extracting and
                            normalizing country codes from institutional affiliations. The processing pipeline
                            aggregated the count of distinct institutions per country, mapping these values to a
                            discrete color threshold scale rendered on a natural earth projection.</li>
                        <li>Treemap: The pipeline processed affiliation data to calculate publication volume per
                            institution, dynamically separating top-tier entities from aggregated minor contributors. In
                            the visualization, publication counts determine the area of each rectangle within a
                            squarified treemap layout, using categorical colors to distinguish specific institutions.

                    <li>Collaborations page</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>People Network: The pipeline extracted unique author identifiers and
                            mapped them to their respective institutions. Relationships were quantified by iterating
                            through publications to identify co-authorship pairs, aggregating the total count of
                            shared works into edge weights. In the final visualization, these weights determine link
                            thickness and node colors encode institutional affiliations.</li>
                        <li>For the flow map of institutions collaborations, nodes were positioned according to their
                            geographic coordinates. Links were established by identifying unique pairs of institutions
                            listed on the same publication, with edge weights representing the aggregated frequency of
                            collaboration.</li>
